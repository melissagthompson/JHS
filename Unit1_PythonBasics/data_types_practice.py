# Python Practice: Data Types, Variables, and String Operations

# 1. Create a variable called 'age' and assign it your age as a number.
# Write your answer below:

age =  # ← Assign your age here

# 2. Create a variable called 'name' and assign it your name as a string.
# Write your answer below:

name =  # ← Assign your name here

# 3. What type of data is stored in 'age' and 'name'? 
# Write your answer as a comment.

# Answer: 

# 4. Convert 'age' into a string and store it in a new variable called 'age_str'.
# Then print: "I am ___ years old." using concatenation.
# Write your answer below:

####age_str = str(age)  # ← Convert age to a string
# print("I am " + ... + " years old.")  # Complete this line

# 5. Try adding an integer and a string together. What happens?
# Write an example and explain the error in a comment.

# Example:
# result = 5 + "hello"

# Error explanation:

# 6. Fix the error from above using type conversion.
# Write your corrected code below:

# Corrected code:

# 7. Create a variable called 'height' and assign it a decimal number.
# Then convert it into an integer and print both values.

####height =  # ← Assign a decimal number
####height_int = int(height)  # ← Convert to an integer

# print both values here

# 8. Using f-strings, print a sentence that says:
# "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

# print(...)  # Use an f-string here

# 9. What is the result of dividing 7 by 2? What about 7 // 2?
# Print both results and explain the difference in a comment.

# print(...)  # Regular division
# print(...)  # Floor division

# Explanation:

# 10. Write a short sentence explaining what you've learned from this practice.
